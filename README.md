# Routing example done the "right" way

There was an example published in August 2012 on
http://trek.github.com/ that was probably the best example I've found
on the minimal things needed for an ember application. Unfortunately,
since ember is evolving so fast the example no longer reflected how
things work.

Around the same time I discovered that example the author had put
together a wonderful example of how development could be done with
ember/js. https://github.com/trek/ember-todos-with-build-tools-tests-and-other-modern-conveniences

So, in order to prove to myself that I know what I'm doing, I'm
converting the first example to the style reflected in the second
example.
